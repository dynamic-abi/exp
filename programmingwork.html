      <h2>Ruff Engine DC-1</h2>

      <p>This is my latest project. A 3D engine created from scratch. Written in vanilla Javascript. It differs from SC-1 in that it features a dynamic camera, so there are much more features to implement
      instead of just a simple rotation matrix.</p>

      <p>Since this is my first time building a 3D engine and I'm splitting the mechanics up into smaller mini projects to work out the math for each function, I thought it would be good idea to build some kind
      of a learning/experimentation workspace in the program that gives me visual guidance as I build it. That way I can see if a function is behaving as it should </p>

      <p>So instead of just having the camera's viewpoint in the program, I have created multiple panels that visualize the 3D space from different angles.
         And the natural coordinates (i.e. their inherent coordinates in the 3D space) of all the elements, vectors and points are fed through functions that draw them on the various viewports. This way I can see
         how everything is moving and verify if everything is behaving as it should. In addition I have written some projection visualization functions that display how the projection rays are travelling to the camera and how it transforms as the camera moves.
      </p>

      <p>For documentation, I've created the following:  </p>
      <p> - A pure technical page that just lists out the program's variables and functions (mostly meant for my own reference)</p>
      <p> - An interactive diagram page that lists out a high level overview of how the entire program works. This diagram contains buttons which further expand into additional windows where you can peek into the inner workings of parts of the program. </p>
      <p> - A Lore and Theory page that explains concepts of the programs and my motivations to create it in a relaxed conversational way with fun diagrams :) </p>

        <br>

      <h4>Current status:</h4>

      <p> I have succesfully implemented a combined rotation system for the camera (Horizontal and then Vertical rotations) </p>

      <p>The program is able to properly visualize three dimensional objects and transform them as the camera rotates in both axis.</p>

      <p>I have arranged a set of cubes in the 3D space which illustrate this</p>

      <h2>Ruff Engine SC-1</h2>

      <p>This was my first attempt at programming projection. After looking up some robotics videos on projection and rotation matrices, I was able to build this
        simple program that dynamically draws vectors and rotates them around the Y axis.
      </p>

      <p>Enter coordinates on the form to create your own shape. Then press the rotate button to watch your 3D shape rotate around the Y axis.</p>
